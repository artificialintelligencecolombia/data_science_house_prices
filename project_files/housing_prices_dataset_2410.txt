SCIKIT LEARN HOUSES DATASET

---------------------
Load the dataset
---------------------

- This dataset is bundled with the scikit learn library (as well as
other datasets). After installing the library on the conda venv,
we can load the dataset.
- The dataset comes in dictionary-like format called bunch. We can work 
directly with this format. But pandas has more features and tools for
data manipulation and easy readability.
