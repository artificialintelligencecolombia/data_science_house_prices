DATA CONVERTION & ANALYSIS
==============================

---------------------
Create the dataframe
---------------------

´´´python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names)
df['MedHouseVal'] = y  # appending target to the dataframe

´´´
- df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names)
constructor method for creating the dataframe. X is the data we
put into the dataframe. 
- columns=feature_names, we ensure that each column
in our DataFrame has the appropriate label corresponding to the feature
it represents.
- df['MedHouseVal']: This specifies a new column named 'MedHouseVal'.
In pandas, if you assign values to a column name that doesn't yet exist
in the DataFrame, pandas will create that column.
- y contains the median house values, which is our dependent variable
or target.

---------------------
Preliminary data analysis
---------------------

Checking the first few rows: print(df.head())
Checking for missing values: print(df.isnull().sum())
Summary statistics: print(df.describe())

---------------------
Regression
---------------------

- First we have to understand classification as the labelind of the data.
In this scenario, the target (HouseMedVal) has no 'cheap' nor 'expensive'
labels. Instead of that, we have a series of real numbers, which makes
it a regression problem.

- If you tried to plot some of these features against the median house
value on a graph, you might see trends. For instance, districts with
higher average incomes might generally have higher house values.

---------------------
Conclusion
---------------------

In simple terms: If you're trying to predict a number (like price,
weight, temperature), it's regression. If you're trying to predict
a category (like spam/not spam, cat/dog/bird), it's classification.
In our dataset, we're predicting a number (median house value), so
it's regression.
