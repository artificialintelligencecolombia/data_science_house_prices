Model Coefficients

[ 4.48674910e-01,  9.72425752e-03, -1.23323343e-01,  7.83144907e-01,
-2.02962058e-06, -3.52631849e-03, -4.19792487e-01, -4.33708065e-01]

Each value in this array corresponds to the coefficient of a
feature in the model. These coefficients represent the change
in the target variable for a one unit change in the feature,
assuming all other features remain constant.

- Positive values indicate a positive correlation with the
target variable.
- Negative values indicate a negative correlation.

The magnitude of the coefficient shows the strength of the
correlation. A larger absolute value indicates a stronger
relationship.

---------------------
Model Intercept
---------------------

-37.023277706064256

This value represents the expected value of the target
variable when all the features are equal to zero. The
intercept can be thought of as the 'baseline' level of
the target variable.

---------------------
Mean Squared Error
---------------------

0.5558915986952441

This value represents the average of the squared differences
between the actual and predicted values of the target variable.
It provides a measure of the model's accuracy.

- A lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
- MSE is sensitive to outliers. A few extreme values can result
in a higher MSE, suggesting a worse fit than might actually be
the case.

Statistics Summary
---------------------

Utilizing the model coefficients, intercept, and MSE, we can
summarize the performance and characteristics of the model.
Understanding these statistics is crucial for interpreting
the modelâ€™s predictions and for identifying potential areas
for improvement.
