==============================
CORRELATION COEFFICIENT 
==============================

The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that calculates
the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of
two variables. The values range between -1.0 and 1.0. 

- POSITIVE correlation that as one variable increases, the other variable
tends to also increase.
- NEGATIVE correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the
other variable tends to decrease.
- NEAR ZERO/ZERO  correlation coefficient indicates a very weak or no
linear relationship between the two variables.

Understanding Correlation code in our Project

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

correlation_matrix = df.corr().round(2)
sns.heatmap(data=correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
´´´
- df.corr().round(2): This line calculates the correlation between all
pairs of columns in our DataFrame, rounding the results to two decimal
places. Each cell in the resulting matrix represents the correlation
between two columns.
sns.heatmap(data=correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm'):
This line generates a heatmap of our correlation matrix using Seaborn
and Matplotlib. The annot=True argument adds annotations to each cell
in the heatmap, displaying the correlation coefficient.
The cmap='coolwarm' argument sets the color map of the heatmap.
