df.describe()
- mean: Represents the central tendency of the data.
Affected by outliers; a few extreme values can skew the mean.

- standard deviation: Measures the amount of variation or dispersion of
a set of values from the mean.A low standard deviation indicates that
the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation
indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
Useful for understanding the variability in the data.
