- `MedInc`: This represents the median income in a block group¹².
It's the median of the total income of all people living in a block
group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the
U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data².

- `HouseAge`: This is the median house age in a block group¹².
It represents the median of the ages of all houses in a block group.

- `AveRooms`: This is the average number of rooms per household¹².
It's calculated by dividing the total number of rooms in all houses
by the number of households in a block group. Note that this is not
per house, but per household, which can include multiple houses.

- `AveBedrms`: This is the average number of bedrooms per household¹².
Similar to `AveRooms`, it's calculated by dividing the total number of
bedrooms in all houses by the number of households in a block group.

- `Population`: This is the total population in a block group¹².

- `AveOccup`: This is the average number of people residing within a
home, i.e., the average household size¹². It's calculated by dividing
the total population by the number of households in a block group.

- `Latitude` and `Longitude`: These represent the geographical
coordinates (latitude and longitude respectively) of a block group¹².

- `MedHouseVal`: This is the median house value for California districts,
expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000)¹². It represents
the median of all house values in a block group.

Please note that since `AveRooms` and `AveBedrms` are provided per
household, these columns may take surprisingly large values for block
groups with few households and many empty houses, such as vacation
resorts².
