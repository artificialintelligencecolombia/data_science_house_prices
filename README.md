## Introduction
The Boston Housing dataset contains information about various houses in Boston through different parameters. This project's main objective is to utilize this data to predict median house prices using machine learning models.

## Setup & Installation
A step-by-step guide to set up and get the project running on your local machine.

- **Prerequisites**: Python, Anaconda
- **Installation Steps**:
    1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repo-link]`
    2. Navigate to the directory: `cd boston-housing-prediction`
    3. Install dependencies: `conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt`

## Data
Detailed description of the dataset, its features, and source.

- **Source**: Mention where you obtained the data. 
- **Features**: 
    - `CRIM`: Per capita crime rate
    - `ZN`: Proportion of residential land zoned
    - (Continue listing other features)

## Methodology
Breakdown of the steps involved in the project, including:

- **Data Cleaning**: Outline steps taken to clean the data.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Insights derived from the initial exploration of the data.
- **Modeling**: Discussion on the algorithms chosen, how they were trained, and their performance metrics.

## Results
Summary of the project's outcomes and findings.

- **Best Model**: e.g., Random Forest with a mean absolute error of XYZ.
- **Feature Importance**: Discuss the most influential features impacting the housing price.

## Deployment
Information about how the model was or can be deployed in a real-world setting.
